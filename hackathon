Storyboard for Hackathon Pitch
Product Name: Grid Maintenance Prioritization Assistant
Theme: Proactively identify, prioritize, and resolve overdue grid maintenance work to improve safety, reliability, and crew efficiency at PG&E.

Slide-by-Slide Pitch Deck Structure

Slide 1: Title Slide
* Title: Grid Maintenance Prioritization Assistant
* Subtitle: Power Platform Solution to Optimize PG&E’s Infrastructure Reliability
* Team Members: GDM
* Tools Used: Power BI, Power Automate, Microsoft Copilot

Slide 2: The Problem
“Maintenance backlog is growing. Field teams are stretched. Delays in repairs create safety, regulatory, and operational risks.”
* Thousands of work orders are managed daily
* Critical assets (transformers, poles, gas valves) require timely attention
* Current tracking is siloed and reactive
* Crew scheduling doesn’t adapt to risk levels
* No real-time prioritization view

Slide 3: The Solution
A Power BI-powered command center + automation engine that gives field ops leaders a real-time view of grid maintenance status and triggers intelligent workflows
* Interactive dashboard to visualize overdue jobs and associated risk
* Alerts sent automatically when work exceeds thresholds
* Crew availability incorporated for smarter assignment
* Copilot responds to natural language questions for decision-making

Slide 4: Workflow Architecture
Power BI Dashboard
* Overdue jobs map + filters (location, risk, asset type)
* Key Metrics: Total overdue, time-to-complete, top regions at risk
Power Automate Flows
* Trigger Teams/email alert for overdue high-risk jobs
* Assign job to crew based on availability
* Weekly digest emailed to regional ops managers
Copilot Use
* Natural language queries:
    * “Which region has the most critical overdue jobs?”
    * “What is the average delay for transformer repairs?”

Slide 5: Sample Power BI Dashboard (Mockup)
We’ll create:
* Map view: Color-coded pins by risk level
* Bar chart: Overdue jobs by region or asset type
* Table view: Work order details with priority score
* KPI tiles: Avg days overdue, # of red-alert jobs, weekly trend

Slide 6: Power Automate Example Flow
* Trigger: New job exceeds 5-day overdue + risk score > 7
* Action: Send notification to Supervisor via Teams
* Secondary Action: Update SharePoint list with status
* Bonus: Weekly regional summary email

Slide 7: Copilot Demo Prompts
* “List top 5 overdue maintenance jobs in the North Bay”
* “Which crews are available for gas valve repairs this week?”
* “How many critical jobs are in the red zone near Fresno?”
Copilot interprets data model behind Power BI and generates answers instantly.

Slide 8: Value to PG&E
* Faster repairs = reduced outages
* Lower risk = regulatory compliance & safety improvement
* Efficient crews = optimized labor & scheduling
* Better insights = executive visibility
“This tool becomes the digital nerve center of maintenance ops.”

Slide 9: What’s Next
* Expand coverage to wildfire risk overlays (add GIS + sensor inputs)
* Integrate predictive asset failure models
* Embed dashboard into Teams or mobile Power App for field crews

Slide 10: Thank You / Q&A
* Quick recap of demo
* Invite judges to test a prompt or scenario
